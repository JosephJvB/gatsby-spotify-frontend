Todos
- Lambda edge from https://jaf-unwrapped.com -> www
- Configure site so can reload at /quiz and redirect to /quiz after reload
  - Check out Gatsby build options
  - react-snap ?

Actually, gatsby says static folder should be used in edge cases only
Fonts, images, css should be inside /src/ for webpack to handle

Tried out gatsby cloud it looks really good tbh but also I don't need it
mostly it handles the stuff i've configured manually, dns, build, deploy
& probably they do some other useful custom integrations
